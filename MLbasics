#Steps to approach an ML problem

- **Problem Statement**: Understand the problem statement and define the business problem that the market basket analysis will solve.
- **Data Collection**: Collect the required data, which will include transactional data, product data, and customer data.
- **Data Exploration**: Explore the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
- **Data Preparation**: Prepare the data for analysis by cleaning, filtering, transforming, and aggregating it.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify product associations and generate recommendations using techniques such as association rules, collaborative filtering, and clustering.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the effectiveness of the market basket analysis model using metrics such as lift, support, and confidence.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model to production and integrate it into the business process.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously monitor the model performance and improve it over time by incorporating new data and refining the algorithms.
