## Steps to approach an ML problem

- **Problem Statement**: Understand the problem statement and define the business problem that the market basket analysis will solve.
- **Data Collection**: Collect the required data, which will include transactional data, product data, and customer data.
- **Data Exploration**: Explore the data to identify patterns, trends, and relationships.
- **Data Preparation**: The first step is to gather, clean, filter, transform, and aggregate the data. Usually retail datasets contain data from over 200,000 users with 3 million orders and 50,000 products. The data needs to be transformed into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify product associations and generate recommendations using techniques such as association rules, collaborative filtering, and clustering.
- **Feature Engineering**: Once the data is cleaned and processed, the next step is to extract relevant features. Features could include user demographics, purchase history, time of day, day of week, and product attributes.
- **Model Selection**: The third step is to select a suitable machine learning model. The goal of this problem is to predict which products a user will reorder. This is a binary classification problem and models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests can be used.
- **Model Training**: Once a suitable model is selected, it needs to be trained on the dataset. The dataset can be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The trained model needs to be evaluated on the testing set. Metrics such as __accuracy__, __precision__, __recall__, __lift__, __support__, __confidence__ and __F1 score__ can be used to evaluate the model's performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The model's hyperparameters need to be tuned to optimize its performance. This can be done using techniques such as grid search or random search.
- **Model Deployment**: Once the model is trained and optimized, it can be deployed in a production environment. The model can be used to make real-time predictions on new data.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Continuously monitor the model performance and improve it over time by incorporating new data and refining the algorithms.
